# Welcome to SereniTea Survey Form!

This is a part of freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) program. I started with the basic HTMl and CSS there on the platform, which I regularly updated on my [GitHub](https://github.com/sleepyweb/freecodecamp) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/sleepyweb/series/22234).

This is my first ever full webpage design with HTML and CSS. I did the basic designing on Figma.
